<H5>The TuneEditor application is not difficult to use.</H5>

<ol>
<li>Enter all of your tune-related fields on in the boxes on the left.</li>
<li>As you edit, the file will be updated in the window on the right.</li>
<li>Click 'Save' when you are happy with it, and the file will be saved.</li>
<li>To create a new file, click 'New'. This doesn't create much - basically it strips away most information, leaving only the directory, transcriber name, and the note length.</li>
<li>Please be respectful of the work of others - do not attribute other's work to yourself. Not cool.</li>
</ol>
