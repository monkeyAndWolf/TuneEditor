<H3>The TuneEditor Application</H3>
<p><i>By Monkey&Wolf, of Sunnyvale California</i></p>

<H5>The TuneEditor application is not difficult to use.</H5>

<ol>
<li>Enter all of your tune-related fields into the boxes on the left.</li>
<li>As you edit, the file will be updated in the window at the bottom of the page.</li>
<li>Click 'Save' when you are happy with it, and the file will be saved into the specified directory. <b>Note!</b>
This is saving the ABC notation as a text file, and not the sheet music.</li>
<li>To create a new file, click 'New'. This doesn't create much - basically it strips away most information,
leaving only the directory, transcriber name, the note length, and the potential to create more music.</li>
<li>If you are not sure how ABC Notation works, then check the ABC Primer. It's in the middle tab :)</li>
</ol>

<H5>Credits &c.</H5>
<p>Produced by an anonymous developer in the Santa Cruz mountains of California.</p>
<p>The ABC Primer was written by John Chambers. Original version is
<a href="http://trillian.mit.edu/~jc/doc/doc/ABCprimer.html">available here.</a> There is plenty more
on the internet.</p>
<p>The transformation from ABC text to Sheet music is achieved using a version of abcm2ps called ABCShot. It
was originally written by a dude called Jeff Moines.</p>
<p>The previous version of this application used ABCJS, embedded in a QtWebKit window. This version uses SVG
rendering - it's not quite as pretty, but there are other advantages which make it worth it. When it comes to
creating beautiful sheet music in HTML, we recommend using ABCJS, available at
<a href="http://abcjs.net/">abcjs.net.</a></p>
<p>If you are in the area, the authors recommend checking out the session in the bakery at Half Moon Bay. It's
on most Saturday afternoons. Come along and play a tune!</i>

<p>We are open source! Check out our code, it's available at
