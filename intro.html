<H3>The TuneEditor Application</H3>
<p><i>By Monkey&Wolf, of Sunnyvale California</i></p>

<H5>The TuneEditor application is not difficult to use.</H5>

<ol>
<li>Enter all of your tune-related fields into the boxes on the left.</li>
<li>As you edit, the file will be updated in the window at the bottom of the page.</li>
<li>Click 'Save' when you are happy with it, and the file will be saved into the specified directory. <b>Note!</b>
This is saving the ABC notation as a text file, and not the sheet music.</li>
<li>You can also export to PDF. Just click on the button named "Export to PDF and choose aa file.</li>
<li>To create a new file, click 'New'. This doesn't create much - basically it strips away most information,
leaving only the directory, transcriber name, the note length, and a template for the ABC details.</li>
<li>If you are not sure how ABC Notation works, then check the ABC Primer. It's in the middle tab :)</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Text Tab:</b> The text tab displays the full text output of the file, and automatically keeps it updated
on the clipboard. So as you are editing the details, the ABC will appear on the clipboard right away, and you
can then paste it into some other place when it's ready. Of course, it would be weird to have the ABC right in
front of you as you edit, but you can do that if you so choose.

<p>Produced by an anonymous developer in the Santa Cruz mountains of California.</p>
<p>The ABC Primer was written by John Chambers. Original version is
<a href="http://trillian.mit.edu/~jc/doc/doc/ABCprimer.html">available here.</a> There is plenty more
on the internet.</p>
<p>The transformation from ABC text to Sheet music is achieved using a version of abcm2ps called ABCShot. It
was originally written by a dude called Jeff Moines, and the M&W guys turned it into a static library. It's on github.</p>
<p>The previous version of this application used ABCJS, embedded in a QtWebKit window. This version uses SVG
rendering - it's not quite as pretty, but there are other advantages which make it worth it. When it comes to
creating beautiful sheet music in HTML, we recommend using ABCJS, available at
<a href="http://abcjs.net/">abcjs.net.</a></p>
<p>If you are in the area, the authors recommend checking out the session in the bakery at Half Moon Bay. It's
on most Saturday afternoons. Come along and play a tune!</i>

<p>We are open source! Check out our code, it's available at
